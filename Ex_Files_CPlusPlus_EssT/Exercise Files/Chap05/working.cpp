//all code happens inside functions - even main is a function
//block of code that is called by and can return a value to another set of code
//functions - reusable conatiners for logical subset of code
//value of variables are passed to function 
//alternative to call by value is to call by reference - can be side effects
//functions can have same name but signature involves all part of the function and is how function is defined
//basis of class methods
